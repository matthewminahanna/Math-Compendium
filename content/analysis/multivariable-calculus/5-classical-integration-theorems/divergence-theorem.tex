\begin{theorem}[Divergence Theorem]
    Suppose that \( R \) is a simple solid region with \( \partial R \) as the boundary with outward orientation. Suppose that \(\vb{F} \in \mathcal{C}^{1}(U; \mathbb{R}^3)\), where \(U \subset \mathbb{R}^3\) is open and contains \(R\). Then 
    \[  \iiint_{R} \mathrm{div}( \vb{F}) \dd{V} =\iiint_{R} \largetriangledown \cdot \vb{F} \dd{V} = \iint_{ \partial R} \vb{F} \cdot \dd{\vb{A}} \]
