Integrals are not only useful for computing areas; they also allow us to calculate volumes. Suppose that for each value of \( x \), we are given a cross-sectional area \( A(x) \). By approximating the solid as a stack of thin slices of thickness \( \dd{x} \), the total volume is obtained in the limit as
\[
    V = \int_{a}^{b} A(x) \, \dd{x}.
\]
