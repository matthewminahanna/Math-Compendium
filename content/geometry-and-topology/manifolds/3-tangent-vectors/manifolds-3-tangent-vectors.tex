The goal of this part is to develop and expand the mechanisms of calculus to smooth manifolds. This chapter aims to introduce one of the main actors: the tangent vector. At first, it might be unclear how one defines a vector on a manifold. We will present several ways to do so, as well as convince you of their equivalence and show that they really do behave like vectors in "flat space."
