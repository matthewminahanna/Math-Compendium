\begin{theorem}
    Let \( H \) and \( K \) be groups and \( \varphi: K \to \mathrm{Aut}(H) \) be a homomorphism. Let \( \cdot \) be the left \( K \)-action on \( H \) as determined by \( \varphi \). Let \( G = H \times K \) and define a multiplication on \( G \) by
    \[ \left( h_{1}, k_{1} \right) \str_{G} \left( h_{2},k_{2} \right) = \left( h_{1} \str_{H} \left( k_{1} \cdot h_{2} \right) , k_{1} \str_{K} k_{2} \right) \]
    Then 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\roman*)}]
        \item The is multiplication makes \( G \) into a group called the \vocab{semidirect product} of \( H \) and \( K \) with respect to \( \varphi \) and we write \( G = H \rtimes_{\varphi} K \) or \( H \rtimes K \) if \( \varphi \) is unambiguous. 
    \end{enumerate}
