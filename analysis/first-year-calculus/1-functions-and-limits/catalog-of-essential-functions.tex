\begin{example}
    Suppose a drug X has a half-life of \( 45 \) minutes in the blood stream and that it is not safe to have more than \( 175 \)mg of the drug in your blood. If Alice took a \( 120 \)mg dose, how long does she have to wait until she can take another \( 120 \)mg dose?\\
    Alice needs to wait until her current drug level drops below \( 55 \) mg (since \( 55 + 120 = 175 \)). We need to determine the time when Alice has less than \( 55 \) mg of drug X left in her system, so we have 
\[  120 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t }{45}} <55.  \]

Dividing both sides by \( 120 \), 
   \begin{equation}
     \left( \frac{1}{2}  \right)^{ \frac{t }{45}} < \frac{55}{120} = \frac{11}{24}. \label{eqn:6/21/25/1} 
\end{equation}

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, 
\[ \frac{t}{45} \ln \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) < \ln \left( \frac{11}{24} \right). \]

Since \( \ln \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) < 0 \), dividing both sides by this negative number flips the inequality:
\[ \frac{t}{45} > \frac{\ln \left( \frac{11}{24} \right)}{ \ln \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}. \]

Therefore,
\[ t >   45 \cdot \frac{\ln \left( \frac{11}{24} \right)}{ \ln \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)} \approx 51 \text{ minutes}. \]

Alice must wait at least 51 minutes before she can take drug X again.

\textbf{Common Mistake:} We can take a different route following from \Cref{eqn:6/21/25/1}. Namely, we might try taking \( \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \) of both sides:
\[  \frac{t}{45} \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) < \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \left( \frac{11}{24} \right). \]

Since \( \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 1 \), this would give us
\[ \frac{t}{45} < \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \left(  \frac{11}{24} \right), \] 
or \[ t < 45 \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \left(  \frac{11}{24} \right) \approx 51 \text{ minutes}. \]

This solution would incorrectly suggest that Alice has to take drug X \textit{before} 51 minutes, which is absurd.

\textbf{What went wrong?} The function \( f(x) = \log_{\frac{1}{2}}(x) \) is decreasing since its base \( \frac{1}{2} < 1 \). For any decreasing function \( f \), we have 
\[ x <y \iff f(x) > f(y). \]

When we applied the decreasing function \( \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \) to both sides of the inequality, we should have flipped the inequality sign:
\[ \frac{t}{45} \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) > \log_{\frac{1}{2}} \left( \frac{11}{24} \right), \]
which gives us the correct answer: \( t > 51 \) minutes.
