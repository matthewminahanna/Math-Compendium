This project benefited from open-source tools and examples created by:\\\\

\textbf{Evan Chen} — The Napkin project served as the initial model for this compendium, and portions of its code are used throughout. GitHub: \url{https://github.com/vEnhance/napkin/} \\

\textbf{Aareyan Manzoor (The TeXromancers)} — Provided permission to reuse the code used for the front cover. GitHub: \url{https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/Texromancers.html} \\

\textbf{Gilles Castel (R.I.P.)} — His work on integrating UltiSnips into LaTeX workflows (I use HyperSnips, a VS Code port) removed many bottlenecks and sped up development. GitHub: \url{https://github.com/gillescastel}
